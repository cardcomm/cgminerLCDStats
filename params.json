See links below for where you can purchase the display used for this project.  \r\n\r\nUpdate: The script now shows an MtGox price ticker alternating on the line with the WU: cgminer stats. There is a delay of a few seconds when updating the ticker. Under no circumstances should it be used for time sensitive activities such as trading.  It is provided only as a convenience for the user.  \r\n\r\nIf you feel this code is useful, please consider a donation to:  \r\n  BTC address: 15aGZp2pCbpAFHcjHVrx2G746PXFo9VEed\r\n\r\nRun as root to avoid permissions issues (see note below): sudo python cgminerLCDStats.py [options]\r\n\r\nUsage: cgminerLCDStats.py [options] arg                                                                                                                                                            \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\nOptions:  \r\n  `-h, --help            show this help message and exit`  \r\n  `-s, --simple          Show simple display layout instead of default`  \r\n  `-d REFRESHDELAY, --refresh-delay=REFRESHDELAY  where  REFRESHDELAY = Time delay between screen/API refresh`                          \r\n  `-i HOST, --host=HOST  I.P.
